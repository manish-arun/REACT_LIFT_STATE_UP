✅ "Lifting Control to the Parent"


🔍 What’s Happening Here?
The state (isChildStateTrue) is maintained in the parent component.
The child component doesn’t manage any state itself, but receives:
The current state value as a prop: childStateValue
A callback to update it: onChildStateChange


📘 This pattern is typically called:
"Controlled component via lifting state up"
Or more broadly, “Lifting state up” from child to parent


🧠 In Simple Terms:
You're letting the parent "own" the state, while the child simply reads and triggers updates to it.
This is useful when:
Multiple children need to read or update the same state
The parent needs to make decisions based on that state
You want more centralized state management
